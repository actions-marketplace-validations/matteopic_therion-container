How to publish
==============

1. Update the Therion's version number in `README.md`, `Dockerfile` and `action.yml`
2. Tag the repository with the same version then push.
3. Wait dockerhub for the successfully build
4. On Github a draft release appears, set the new version number then `Publish release`.
